# Great Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba, Spain

"Dating to the 8th century, the Great Mosque of Cordoba is an example of Umayyad sacred architecture in what is current Spain. While this structure had its formations in the 780’s C.E., it expanded over the next two centuries eventually doubling from its original size. Like other mosques and Islamic architecture from the period of Islamic rule in Spain, the Great Mosque of Cordoba was transformed by later ruling Catholic Spaniards. Despite these transformations, the Great Mosque of Cordoba remains significant to Islamic art and architecture through its decorative tradition and the architectural features that attribute to the sacredness of the building.

The decorative tradition reflects Umayyad tradition previous to exile in Spain using mosaics, calligraphy, illumination elements, and expensive materials that are carved or manipulated. Although other rulers, before and after the Umayyads, used similar decorative elements, the Umayyads differ in the composition of them. 

The architectural features of the Great Mosque of Cordoba include: the mihrab, domes, hypostyle layout, minarets, horseshoe arches and double arches, maqsura, and the courtyard (Bloom and Blair, 141-146, 1997). Three main features of importance are the mihrab, arcades (including the columns and arches), and the main dome. 

Together the two aspects of architecture and decoration in these three features carry symbolic meaning beyond the visual to create a spiritual experience in the Great Mosque of Cordoba. Creating a spiritual experience through the architecture enhances the relationship of the Muslims experiencing the space to Allah." Gleason.
